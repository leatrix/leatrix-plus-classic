1.15.64f.alpha.1 - 8th December 2024

The Leatrix Plus project has moved.

Remove this copy of Leatrix Plus.
Find the new Leatrix Plus addon on CurseForge App, CurseForge website or leatrix.com.
Install Leatrix Plus from there.

This copy of Leatrix Plus you have installed right now won't work or get any updates.
Delete this copy and go grab the new project version.

The new project is at:
www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus

(there is an in-game banner and voice message but if it's not a convenient time, you can close the banner and doing so will also stop the voice message from playing)
