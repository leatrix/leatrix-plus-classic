- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has three new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.

The third is 'Hide world map button' (this applies to Season of Mastery only).  The zone text bar is now always hidden.
- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.
- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.

The setting to dismount when selecting a flight point has been removed as it's now built into the game.
- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.

1.13.73 - 21st July 2020
- The 'Manage frames' option no longer modifies the widget top center frame.  Instead, there is a new option called 'Manage widget' ('Frames').  If enabled, you will be able to position and scale the widget top center frame.

- If 'Automate quests' is enabled ('Automation'), you can now instruct Leatrix Plus to only automate quests if you are holding down the shift key using a new setting in the configuration panel.

Note that battlemaster and cloth quartermaster quest automation requires quest title translation so some locales may not work for all quests yet.
- The 'Accept summon' option ('Automation') will now wait 10 seconds before automatically accepting a summon request giving you the opportunity to cancel the summon if needed.

1.13.63 - 13th May 2020
- Fixed an issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused a Lua error when looting an item with Master Looter enabled.  Rare caveat: After you slay a monster with Master Looter enabled, if you disable Master Looter before the loot has been assigned and then attempt to loot the same monster with Master Looter disabled, you may still see the error.  This is a rare exception though as you wouldn't normally disable Master Looter after slaying a monster until you have assigned loot so you will probably never see the error.

1.13.61 - 6th May 2020
- If 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') is enabled, automated resurrection will succeed even if there is a resurrection delay timer.  Also fixed a bug which caused the 'Accept' button to do nothing after a resurrection delay timer has passed.  In addition, resurrection requests from 'Chained Spirit' (Bloodlord Mandokir, Zul'Gurub) will no longer be accepted automatically.
- If 'Automate quests' ('Automation') is enabled, quests from Rin'wosho the Trader (Zul'Gurub Isle, Stranglethorn Vale) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.

- Leatrix Plus is now partially translated into German.

1.13.59 - 22nd April 2020

- Leatrix Plus is now listed in the game options panel.

1.13.35 - 16th October 2019

- Fixed a an issue which caused tooltips from the 'ClassicCodex' addon to not be shown if 'Manage tooltip' was enabled.  This fix involved making changes to the ClassicCodex code.  I have submitted a GitHub ticket to ask the author of ClassicCodex to add the fix code to ClassicCodex instead.
- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance quest log' ('Interface') which caused the map button border to be colored incorrectly when using ElvUI with a custom profile.

- The quest log frame for the 'Enhance quest log' option ('Interface') has been updated.  It now uses the game's built in double-wide texture rather than a custom texture.  If you use ElvUI, make sure it's up to date for the new quest log to work properly.

1.13.27 - 4th September 2019
- If 'Manage tooltip' is enabled, you can set a new dropdown menu in the configuration panel to anchor the tooltip in various ways.

1.13.25 - 24th August 2019

- The media library in Leatrix Plus (Classic) features music files rather than the sound kits that Leatrix Plus (Retail) features.  All playable music files in the game and both videos are included and continuous play is supported.
- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') shows the links above the quest log frame rather than inside it.
